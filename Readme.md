# CV Project

`About This:`

My second ASP.NET MVC application. (and also the last one)
I did not know Web projects at all so I wanted to learn it. I was fiddling around with ASP.Net Razor and decided to build a project for my hobbies. one year later I wanted to build a website for me. I wanted to put my projects in it so I built this website (around **2016-2017**) which is very similar to the original project I had built.

I put the project as a web app into a host with a proper domain (my name) but later I dropped the host. There were stuff I could not do more because of the host limitations but I do not remember what these were. I had to move the host once because the host was always unresponsive and tech support was non-existent. I lost manyt things during the migration as well (real code, because the project code was also part of this project).

It is quite old and nowadays people do not use this tech stack anymore. But the main point was learning everything from scratch. I wanted to learn web and I did it. I should have gone with JS based web frameworks but at the time I was looking around, this tech stack was an option. I did not have anyone to review it and I bet it is quite mundane/useless.

`Technology:`
- ASP.NET MVC 5 Razor, .Net Framework 4
- Entity Framework 6, plain tables
